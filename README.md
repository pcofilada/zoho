# Zoho

Ruby wrapper for Zoho API. For additional documentation visit: https://www.zoho.com/developer/rest-api.html

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zoho_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zoho_ruby

## Configuration
Zoho API requires `organization_id` and `auth_token`. Visit https://www.zoho.com/developer/rest-api.html for instruction on how to get `organization_id` and `auth_token`.

If you have the `organization_id` and `auth_token` already, here's what you need to do, If you are using Rails setup `config/initializers/zoho.rb`.

```
Zoho.configure do |config|
  config.organization_id = 'your_organization_id'
  config.auth_token      = 'your_auth_token'
  config.per_page        = 20 # Default and maximum items per page is 200
end
```
